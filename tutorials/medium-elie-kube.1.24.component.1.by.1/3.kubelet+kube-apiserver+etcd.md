# kubelet + kube-apiserver + etcd

- https://medium.com/@ElieXU/kubelet-api-server-8e2bdd6a147e

This post expands on the previous 2 posts which setup `kubelet`
We will add the Kubernetes `api-server`
The api-server is a component of the `control plane`
The api-server is the front-end of the control plane
The main implementation of a Kubernetes API server is `kube-apiserver`

When `kubelet` talks to `kube-apiserver`, it is no longer standalone
`kubelet` will now be in API Server mode
`kubelet` will no longer watch the static pod directory
- We configured `~/k8s/kubelet-static-pod/` previously
- Now, we will configure `kubelet` to talk to `kube-apiserver` and
  create Pods from there

Kubernetes uses `etcd` to store the cluster data

When we run `kubelet` to create a `pod`
`kubelet` will talk to `api-server`
the Pod defintion will be written to `etcd`
the `kube-scheduler` will also be involved

## First, an etcd single-node cluster

We need an `etcd` cluster so the API server can talk to its
