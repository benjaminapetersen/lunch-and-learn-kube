# Kind?

Does this series give insight into how `kind` works?

A guess, as I am starting part 3 (etcd+api-server):
Essentially, is `containerd` configured to watch a
static pod directory, where YAML for Pods for api-server
and other components wil be deployed.  Kubelet will
create the pods for these components.  Then, a kubeconfig
will be created that will be configured to talk to the API
server running as a POD in kind. The API server will be
configured to schedule pods to this single node where kind
is running, which is where the kubelet will continue to
deploy new pods.

I will have to revise this as I continue through the course.
