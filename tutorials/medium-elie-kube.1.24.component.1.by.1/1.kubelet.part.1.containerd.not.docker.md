# Kubelet Part 1

I had trouble getting `docker`, `docker-cri`, `containerd`, etc all working and
running in my Vagrant VM.  Docker kept crashing.  After fiddling for a bit, I chose
to stop messing with Docker and instead go to `containerd`.  This seemed to work well.

# qemu Ubuntu containerd

- a few on containerd
  - The Getting Started doc:

  - additional references

## Getting containerd up and running... so we can get kubelets

- Find a `containerd` release: https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases

```bash
# chose the non-static version
# dang there is a lot of these
wget https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/download/v2.0.0-rc.3/containerd-2.0.0-rc.3-linux-arm64.tar.gz
# unpack it all to /usr/local
sudo tar Cxzvf /usr/local containerd-2.0.0-rc.3-linux-arm64.tar.gz

# get the .service file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/main/containerd.service
# dilemma...
# this doesn't exist
ls /usr/local/lib/systemd/system/ | grep ".service" # sad
# this exists
ls /lib/systemd/system/ | grep ".service" # happy
# so I'll put it in /lib/systemd/system/ since I see other .service files there
sudo mv containerd.service /lib/systemd/system/

# turn it on
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now containerd
# Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/containerd.service â†’ /lib/systemd/system/containerd.service.
```

- Find a `runc` release: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases

```bash
# simpler list than containerd
wget https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/download/v1.1.13/runc.arm64
# install it in local, but binaries that require super user (sbin)
sudo install -m 755 runc.arm64 /usr/local/sbin/runc
```

- Find the CNI plugins on releases: https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases

```bash
wget https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v1.5.1/cni-plugins-linux-arm64-v1.5.1.tgz
# install into optional packges dir
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
# unpack
sudo tar Cxzvf /opt/cni/bin cni-plugins-linux-arm64-v1.5.1.tgz
# ./
# ./dhcp
# ./loopback
# ./README.md
# ./bandwidth
# ./ipvlan
# ./vlan
# ./static
# ./host-device
# ./LICENSE
# ./bridge
# ./dummy
# ./tuning
# ./vrf
# ./tap
# ./portmap
# ./firewall
# ./ptp
# ./host-local
# ./macvlan
# ./sbr
```

Test installing and running a container

```bash
# sure can! this does things.  all kinds of positive output.
sudo ctr images pull docker.io/library/redis:alpine
sudo ctr run docker.io/library/redis:alpine redis
```

## Optional, nerdctl

- Get `nerdctl` because we want a `docker`-like UI/UX since `ctr` and `crictl`
do not provide much of a UX (just for debugging): https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/releases

```bash
wget https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/releases/download/v2.0.0-beta.5/nerdctl-2.0.0-beta.5-linux-arm64.tar.gz
# seems an ok place to untar, /usr/local/bin
sudo tar Cxzvf /usr/local/bin nerdctl-2.0.0-beta.5-linux-arm64.tar.gz
# nerdctl
# containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh
# containerd-rootless.sh
```

Well now, can we run a container?

```bash
# this complains about rootless setup
nerdctl run -it --rm alpine
# this is fine.  prob not best practices, but at least runs!
sudo nerdctl run -it --rm alpine
# pull an image with ctr? looks like it works
sudo ctr images pull docker.io/library/redis:alpine
```

## Kubelet

Get it? Or Build it?

```bash
# get it
wget https://dl.k8s.io/v1.24.3/bin/linux/amd64/kubelet
chmod +x ./kubelet

# or, build it
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.git
sudo apt install make
cd kubernetes
make
ls _output/bin/
cd ../
# put a symlink to kubelet in vagrant home dir
ln -s ./kubernetes/_output/bin/kubelet ./kubelet
```

Create a config file:

```yaml
# I believe this is from the tutorial, but I don't recall.
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
enableServer: false
#staticPodPath: /home/opc/k8s/kubelet-static-pod
staticPodPath: /home/vagrant/k8s/kubelet-static-pod
readOnlyPort: 10250
failSwapOn: false
podCIDR: 10.241.1.0/24
authentication:
  anonymous:
    enabled: true
  webhook:
    enabled: false
authorization:
  mode: AlwaysAllow
```

Then, run it:

```bash
# gotta sudo, or will get containerd.socket errors
# need to look into this.
sudo ./kubelet --config ./configs/kubeletConfigFile.yaml

# seems to be happy
ps -aux | grep kubelet
root       69739  0.0  0.1  13376  4656 pts/0    S+   22:15   0:00 sudo ./kubelet --config ./configs/kubeletConfigFile.yaml
root       69740  0.0  0.0  13376   680 pts/1    Ss   22:15   0:00 sudo ./kubelet --config ./configs/kubeletConfigFile.yaml
root       69741  1.0  1.7 1300528 70216 pts/1   Sl+  22:15   0:01 ./kubelet --config ./configs/kubeletConfigFile.yaml
vagrant    70051  0.0  0.0   6416  1856 pts/2    S+   22:16   0:00 grep --color=auto kubelet
```

## Run a pod by provding a yaml file in the configured directory

```bash
vim ~/k8s/kubelet-static-pod/nginx.yaml
```
Which is:

```yaml
# only pods!  Kubeletes don't know what Deployments are.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /var/log/nginx
      name: nginx-logs
  - name: log-truncator
    image: busybox
    command:
    - /bin/sh
    args: [-c, 'while true; do cat /dev/null > /logdir/access.log; sleep 10; done']
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /logdir
      name: nginx-logs
  volumes:
  - name: nginx-logs
    emptyDir: {}
```
Check for running:

```bash
# nerdctl is the "docker-like" UX
# ctr is not as nice
sudo nerdctl ps
# hmm... this is fishy. is it correct?
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE    COMMAND    CREATED    STATUS    PORTS    NAMES

# we can ask the kubelet with a GET request
# looks like there is a bit more to the story
curl http://localhost:10250/pods/ | jq . | head # kind of a lot
curl http://localhost:10250/pods/ | jq '.items[] | length' # 3
curl http://localhost:10250/pods/ | jq -r '.items[].metadata.name' # not 3, but above says 3? hmm...
# nginx-qemu-ubuntu-containerd
# foo-app-qemu-ubuntu-containerd
```


## Rootless Containerd?  Do We Need It? Not sure for now, so skipping.

- https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl?tab=readme-ov-file#rootless-mode

So, fortunately `containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh` came with `nerdctl`:

```bash
# we unpackaged this into /usr/local/bin together
nerdctl
containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh
containerd-rootless.sh
```
So, we can run

```bash
which containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh
sudo containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
# [INFO] Checking RootlessKit functionality
# /usr/local/bin/containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh: 110: rootlesskit: not found
# [ERROR] RootlessKit failed, see the error messages and https://rootlesscontaine.rs/getting-started/common/ .
```
But this seems like a rabbit hole.

TODO: go figure out rootless containers... maybe later?
