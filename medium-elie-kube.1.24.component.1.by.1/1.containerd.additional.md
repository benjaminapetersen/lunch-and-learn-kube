# Containerd

https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md

This is a bit of extra homework on `containerd` to support the main first
article to run the `kubelet`.

## Basics:

- `ctr` is a cli bundled with containerd, but its for debugging only
- `nerdctl` is a human friendly native cli
- `crictl` is another, only debugging


```bash
# it is running?
sudo systemctl is-active containerd
sudo systemctl is-active containerd.service
sudo systemctl is-active containerd.socket

# enable
sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd.socket

# then run?
sudo systemctl start containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd.service
sudo systemctl start containerd.socket

```
