# Kubernetes 1.24+ components one by one series

- https://medium.com/@ElieXU/kubernetes-1-24-components-one-by-one-series-4ebfb197f32a 

As of writing this, Kubernetes supports the following versions:
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/supported-doc-versions/
    - v1.30 
    - v1.29 
    - v1.28 
    - v1.27 
    - v1.26

So since the above document is for Kubernetes 1.24, it is likely there will be bumps.
