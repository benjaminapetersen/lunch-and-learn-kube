# Kubelet Part 1

- https://medium.com/@ElieXU/run-kubelet-standalone-using-docker-engine-7b0638244e3d

Part one here will run just the kubelet.
Kubelet will require Docker or an alternative compliant container runtime.
- Part 2 will go into CNI

## Kubelet

- Is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster
- Ensures containers are running in a pod
- Handles `PodSpecs`
    - Provided through various mechanisms
    - Ensures containers described in `PodSpecs` are healthy
- Does not manage containers not created by Kubernetes

## Building Kubelet

- Does not really build on MacOS (probably can set a target with Go Build)

## Repository: Build the Code

- https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
- git clone the repo
- make

```bash
# this might take a while ðŸ˜Ž
make                                                        05:35:28 PM

This creates:

```bash

â”œâ”€â”€ kubelet                 # we will look at this
â”œâ”€â”€ kubemark
â””â”€â”€ mounter 
```

So we built everything, but `kubelet` will not run on MacOS.

## Kubelet requirements

Kubelet cannot do its job on its own.  It needs some additional bits:

- Docker Engine or another container runtime:
    - containerd
    - CRI-O
    - Docoerk Engine
    - Mirantis Container Runtime
- cri-dockerd
- Network plugin
- (kubelet)

Time to install.  Depending on your Linux flavor, use:

- yum
- rpm
- dnf
- apt-get
- apt (newer and more user friendly than apt-get)

Given I am using `Ubuntu`, I will use `apt`.


### Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu

- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
    - This works well, its not hard to install docker, though it is several steps

Now, we will need to start `docker`.  

```bash
# sudo required on the vagrant box
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### Installing cri-dockerd

BUT! `dockershim` has been removed from Kubernetes as of `1.24`.
To solve?
- install `cri-dockerd` instructions are available here:
    - https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd
- start `cri-dockerd` service on Ubuntu

To get the package, check the [releases page](https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases) and 
pick something reasonable.  

Get your `OS` and `ARCH` so you know what package you need:

```bash
# on ubuntu
dpkg --print-architecture # arm64
# on RPM based systems
rpm --eval '%{_arch}'

# then also 
uname -a
# Linux ubuntu-via-qemu 5.15.0-76-generic #83-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 15 19:21:56 UTC 2023 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux

# and while at it might as well get the release details
lsb_release -a
# No LSB modules are available.
# Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
# Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
# Release:	22.04
# Codename:	jammy ---> 21 April 2022, is old, but an LTR release
```
As of `June 19, 2024`, the latest on the releases page is:
- https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases/download/v0.3.14/cri-dockerd-0.3.14.amd64.tgz.
But, Ubuntu Jammy is from `April 2022`, so we can scroll back and see:
- https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases/download/v0.2.2/cri-dockerd_0.2.2.3-0.ubuntu-jammy_amd64.deb
But, this is `amd64` and we are `arm64`, so we can just use:
    - https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases/download/v0.2.2/cri-dockerd-0.2.2.arm64.tgz

```bash
# get the package
wget https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases/download/v0.2.2/cri-dockerd-0.2.2.arm64.tgz

# expand it
tar xvf cri-dockerd-0.2.2.arm64.tgz

# install it
# could sudo mv as well, we don't need to keep it locally
sudo cp -aR ./cri-dockerd/cri-dockerd /usr/local/bin/ 

# is it usable? should be
cri-dockerd -h
```

Now, gotta start it, probably with `systemd`.  

```bash
which systemd # yup, got it
```
