# Kubelet Part 1

- https://medium.com/@ElieXU/run-kubelet-standalone-using-docker-engine-7b0638244e3d

Part one here will run just the kubelet.
Kubelet will require Docker or an alternative compliant container runtime.
- Part 2 will go into CNI

## A Note on Vagrant

- I am using Vagrant to run Ubuntu via qemu on MacOS Silicon.
- Many commands here require `sudo` to work.  In a real env, we
  try not to `sudo` all the things.

## A Note on Ubuntu

- As stated, I am using Ubuntu.  For some commands it is important to
  know the OS and arch:

```bash
# on ubuntu
dpkg --print-architecture # arm64
# on RPM based systems
rpm --eval '%{_arch}'

# then also
uname -a
# Linux ubuntu-via-qemu 5.15.0-76-generic #83-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 15 19:21:56 UTC 2023 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux

# and while at it might as well get the release details
lsb_release -a
# No LSB modules are available.
# Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
# Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
# Release:	22.04
# Codename:	jammy ---> 21 April 2022, is old, but an LTR release
```

## Kubelet

- Is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster
- Ensures containers are running in a pod
- Handles `PodSpecs`
    - Provided through various mechanisms
    - Ensures containers described in `PodSpecs` are healthy
- Does not manage containers not created by Kubernetes

## Golang

We will need `golang` installed.
Downloads of golang are here:
- https://go.dev/dl/

```bash
# need to know if we are arm, which we are
dpkg --print-architecture # arm64
# so, at https://go.dev/dl/ pick the correct version
# for Linux arm64
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.4.linux-arm64.tar.gz
# not supposed to untar into the current location, per the docs
# this will create a fresh Go tree in /usr/local/go
# do not untar into an existing /usr/local/go, make sure to remove
# the existing. Otherwise things might not work
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.4.linux-arm64.tar.gz

# add to path!
vim .profile
# export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

source ~/.profile
which go
go version
```

## Building Kubelet

NOTE: Kubelet will not run on MacOS, but we can build the kubernetes
repository fine.

## Repository: Build the Code

- https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
- `git clone...` the repo
- `git checkout <version>`
- Run `make` in the root and build all the binaries

NOTE: the article we are following uses `kuberentes v1.24.x`.  I skimmed
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases?page=6 and found
`v1.24.17` seems to be the latest version of `v1.24.x`.  So, I am going
to use that to see if I can replicate the article.

NOTE: This means I will likely have to go find versions of other tools that
match.  Since Kubernetes 1.24 is several years old and no longer supported,
I am sure that I am in for an adventure.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
git checkout v1.24.17 # 😬
# this might take a while 😎
make                                                        05:35:28 PM

So we built everything, but `kubelet` will not run on MacOS.

## Kubelet requirements

Kubelet cannot do its job on its own.  It needs some additional bits:

- Docker Engine or another container runtime:
    - containerd
    - CRI-O
    - Docoerk Engine
    - Mirantis Container Runtime
- cri-dockerd
- Network plugin
- (kubelet)

Time to install.  Depending on your Linux flavor, use:

- yum
- rpm
- dnf
- apt-get
- apt (newer and more user friendly than apt-get)

Given I am using `Ubuntu`, I will use `apt`.

### Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu

- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
    - This works well, its not hard to install docker, though it is several steps

Run all of this and docker should be ready to roll.

```bash
# per the docs, delete any old docker
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done

# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# then, finally, install
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# and check if it works
sudo docker run hello-world
```

Now, we will need to start the `docker` daemon.

```bash
# sudo required on the vagrant box
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```

But Kubernetes stopped supporting Docker as a container runtime since Docker got
bloated.  So we will need to go find the shims.

### Installing cri-dockerd... a version for our Ubuntu version

Since `dockershim` has been removed from Kubernetes as of `1.24`, we need to
fill the gap to get Docker working, or we would need to go to another container
runtime.  Since I'm fairly familar with Docker, I chose to hack through this
and continue to follow along with the article (which also chose Docker).

For a little more info, I went to the following:
  - [Installation post from Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/how-to-install-cri-dockerd-and-migrate-nodes-from-dockershim)

To solve?
- The [article we are following](https://medium.com/@ElieXU/run-kubelet-standalone-using-docker-engine-7b0638244e3d) uses the
  git repository to `it clone https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd`.  Since
  the article is for Kubernetes 1.24, I am skeptical the latest version of `cri-dockerd`
  will work.  Also, we setup an `Ubuntu` that might not be "latest" via our Vagrant
  setup. We are running `/ubuntu-2204-arm64` which is https://app.vagrantup.com/perk/boxes/ubuntu-2204-arm64,
  which is not terribly old, but not "latest and greatest" either.
  - Therefore, I went to the docs from Mirantis to install to learn a bit more
- install `cri-dockerd` instructions are available here:
    - https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd
- start `cri-dockerd` service on Ubuntu
  - Further instructions below

To get the package, check the
  [releases page](https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases) and pick
  something reasonable.

Get your `OS` and `ARCH` so you know what package you need:

```bash
# on ubuntu
dpkg --print-architecture # arm64
# on RPM based systems
rpm --eval '%{_arch}'

# then also
uname -a
# Linux ubuntu-via-qemu 5.15.0-76-generic #83-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 15 19:21:56 UTC 2023 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux

# and while at it might as well get the release details
lsb_release -a
# No LSB modules are available.
# Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
# Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
# Release:	22.04
# Codename:	jammy ---> 21 April 2022, is old, but an LTR release
```

Assessment:

- As of `June 19, 2024`, the latest on the releases page is:
  - https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases/download/v0.3.14/cri-dockerd-0.3.14.amd64.tgz.
- But, Ubuntu Jammy is from `April 2022`, so we can scroll back and see:
  - https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases/download/v0.2.2/cri-dockerd_0.2.2.3-0.ubuntu-jammy_amd64.deb
- But, this is `amd64` and we are `arm64`, so we can just use:
    - 🎯 https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases/download/v0.2.2/cri-dockerd-0.2.2.arm64.tgz
    - NOTE: this version seemed to work well.

```bash
# get the package
wget https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases/download/v0.2.2/cri-dockerd-0.2.2.arm64.tgz

# expand it
tar xvf cri-dockerd-0.2.2.arm64.tgz

# install it
# could sudo mv as well, we don't need to keep it locally
sudo cp -aR ./cri-dockerd/cri-dockerd /usr/local/bin/

# is it usable? should be
cri-dockerd --help
```

Now, gotta start it with `systemd`.

```bash
# systemd is standard in the linux world for ~ 10 years or so now
#   systemd tracks processes via the Linux kernel's cgroups subsystem
#   instead of using process identifiers (PIDs).  This prevents daemons
#   from "escaping" systemd.
# systemctl is a part of systemd, it is the command to use to
# interact with system components
which systemd

# there should be a couple files for docker
# at one or the other
ls /etc/systemd/system | grep docker
ls /lib/systemd/system | grep docker # for Ubuntu, I see them here
# docker.service
# docker.socket

# back up the existing files, just in case
mkdir ~/systemd.bak
sudo mv /lib/systemd/system/docker.socket ~/systemd.bak/docker.socket
sudo mv /lib/systemd/system/docker.service ~/systemd.bak/docker.service

# grab the recommended ones from Mirantis
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/master/packaging/systemd/cri-docker.service
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/master/packaging/systemd/cri-docker.socket
sudo mv cri-docker.socket cri-docker.service /etc/systemd/system/

# there are existing docker files in these directories, some we will
# now be editing
ls /usr/bin/ | grep docker
# docker
# docker-proxy
# dockerd
# dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh
# dockerd-rootless.sh
# rootlesskit-docker-proxy
ls /usr/local/bin/ | grep docker
# cri-dockerd
# cri-dockerd-dir

# using sed like this:
#   sed --in-place --expression ...
# we are adjusting some basic config (locations)
sudo sed -i -e 's,/usr/bin/cri-dockerd,/usr/local/bin/cri-dockerd,' /etc/systemd/system/cri-docker.service

# configure cri-docker
# need to do "sudo" inside vagrant
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable cri-docker.service
# Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/cri-docker.service → /etc/systemd/system/cri-docker.service.
sudo systemctl enable --now cri-docker.socket
# Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/cri-docker.socket → /etc/systemd/system/cri-docker.socket.

# check it!
systemctl status cri-docker.socket
# ● cri-docker.socket - CRI Docker Socket for the API
#      Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/cri-docker.socket; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
#      Active: active (listening) since Sat 2024-06-22 15:41:08 UTC; 11s ago
#    Triggers: ● cri-docker.service
#      Listen: /run/cri-dockerd.sock (Stream)
#       Tasks: 0 (limit: 4607)
#      Memory: 0B
#         CPU: 579us
#      CGroup: /system.slice/cri-docker.socket
```

If `systemctl status cri-docker.socket` checks out, we should be set to
continue onward.

## Installing a Network plugin

`cri-dockerd` (or any Container Runtime) in a network context, is a daemon on
a node configured to provide CRI (Container Runtime Interface) Services
for a kubelet.

The Container Runtime needs to be configured to load the
CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins to implement the Kubernetes
networking model.

There are installtion instructions here:
- https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/main/contrib/cni/README.md

Basics:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins
# name it something reasonable
mv plugins containernetworking_plugins
cd containernetworking_plugins/
git checkout v1.1.1
./build_linux.sh # this seems to do quite a bit!
# Building plugins
#   bandwidth
#   firewall
#   portmap
#   sbr
#   tuning
#   vrf
#   bridge
#   host-device
#   ipvlan
#   loopback
#   macvlan
#   ptp
#   vlan
#   dhcp
#   host-local
#   static
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
sudo cp bin/* /opt/cni/bin
```

## And the Kubelet!

We cloned and build kubernetes locally:

```bash
ls -la kubernetes/_output/bin/
# total 927004
# drwxrwxr-x 4 vagrant vagrant      4096 Jun 19 16:55 .
# drwxrwxr-x 3 vagrant vagrant      4096 Jun 18 23:40 ..

# -rwxr-xr-x 1 vagrant vagrant   1638552 Jun 18 23:40 mounter
```
So we should have a working kubelet.  We could have:

```bash
# instead of building it
$ wget https://dl.k8s.io/v1.24.3/bin/linux/amd64/kubelet
$ chmod +x ./kubelet
```

Lets use the one we built

```bash
cp kubernetes/_output/bin/kubelet ~/kubelet
# we probably want kubectl as well
cp kubernetes/_output/bin/kubectl ~/kubectl
```

to run it, we need a `KubeletConfiguration` object.  Lets make:

```bash
mkdir configs
vim configs/kubeletConfigFile.yaml
```
And use:

```yaml
# TODO: go read the docs about this file
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/
# one quick note:
#  containerRuntimeEndpoint seems to be requird, such as:
#      "containerRuntimeEndpoint": "unix:///var/run/crio/crio.sock"
#
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
enableServer: false
# we will read static files from disk, rather than poll an API
# to begin with
staticPodPath: /home/opc/k8s/kubelet-static-pod
readOnlyPort: 10250
failSwapOn: false
podCIDR: 10.241.1.0/24
authentication:
  anonymous:
    enabled: true
  webhook:
    enabled: false
authorization:
  mode: AlwaysAllow
```
The suggested command in the article is this:

```bash
# but it appears that some of these flags have been deprecated
# and the configuration file is highly preferred
# see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/
./kubelet --config=/home/opc/k8s/configs/kubeletConfigFile.yaml --container-runtime=remote --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///run/cri-dockerd.sock
```
So we go visit [the kubelet config file docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/)

Some of the suggested configuration here seems to make sense:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
# serve on this IP address
address: "192.168.0.8"
# not sure why 20250 vs 10250 is specified, look to see if matters
port: 20250
# lets skip this, we are not pulling images, we want
# the config to watch a local file system
# serializeImagePulls: false

# this seems like a good idea, don't blow up our box
evictionHard:
    memory.available:  "100Mi"
    nodefs.available:  "10%"
    nodefs.inodesFree: "5%"
    imagefs.available: "15%"
```
So combining:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
# interesting the server is disabled by default?
enableServer: false
# I believe these are set to default values, but good
# to keep in mind that they exist:
# "syncFrequency": "1m0s",
# "fileCheckFrequency": "20s",
# "httpCheckFrequency": "20s",
# certs are important, we should circle back and understand this:
# "tlsCertFile": "/var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet.crt",
# "tlsPrivateKeyFile": "/var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet.key",
# we will read static files from disk, rather than poll an API
# to begin with
staticPodPath: /home/opc/k8s/kubelet-static-pod
readOnlyPort: 10250
failSwapOn: false
podCIDR: 10.241.1.0/24
authentication:
  anonymous:
    enabled: true
  webhook:
    enabled: false
  # we would set this in a real env.
  # probably should set this up anyway.
  # x509:
  #  clientCAFile: "/var/run/kubernetes/client-ca.crt"
authorization:

evictionHard:
  memory.available:  "100Mi"
  nodefs.available:  "10%"
  nodefs.inodesFree: "5%"
  imagefs.available: "15%"
# lots more is defaulted.
```

The [kubelet configuration reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/)

So I gave it a run:

```bash
sudo ./kubelet --config ./configs/kubeletConfigFile.yaml
# I0622 16:59:23.312817   74220 server.go:486] "Kubelet version" kubeletVersion="v1.31.0-alpha.2.14+bd88faee8bb3b4"

# E0622 16:59:23.314647   74220 run.go:72] "command failed" err="failed to run Kubelet: validate service connection: validate CRI v1 runtime API for endpoint \"unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock\": rpc error: code = Unimplemented desc = unknown service runtime.v1.RuntimeService"
```

Curious error.  Off to debug!

- https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/4581#issuecomment-1500580964
  - suggests editing the `/etc/containerd/config.toml` and comment out
    the line `disabled_plugins = ["cri"]`.  Didn't seem to do anything for me.

So we need to debug stuff.

```bash
# simplest
services-active.sh
# maybe better
services-check.sh
# at least a loop
services-restart.sh
```

This will be `services-active.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# docker
systemctl status docker | grep 'Active'
systemctl status docker.service | grep 'Active'
systemctl status docker.socket | grep 'Active' # not a thing?
# cri-docker
systemctl status cri-docker | grep 'Active'
systemctl status cri-docker.service | grep 'Active'
systemctl status cri-docker.socket | grep 'Active'
# containerd
systemctl status containerd | grep 'Active'
systemctl status containerd.service | grep 'Active'
systemctl status containerd.socket | grep 'Active' # not a thing?
```
Perhaps a little better in `services-check.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# docker
echo "DOCKER, .service, .status"
systemctl is-active docker
systemctl is-active docker.service
systemctl is-active docker.socket # not a thing?
# cri-docker
echo "CRI-DOCKER, .service, .status"
systemctl is-active cri-docker
systemctl is-active cri-docker.service
systemctl is-active cri-docker.socket
# containerd
echo "CONTAINERD, .service, .status"
systemctl is-active containerd
systemctl is-active containerd.service
systemctl is-active containerd.socket # not a thing?
```

And a restart script in `services-restart.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
declare -a arr=("docker" "docker.service" "docker.socket"
                "cri-docker" "cri-docker.service" "cri-docker.socket"
                "containerd" "containerd.service" "containerd.socket")
for i in "${arr[@]}"
do
   echo "check $i for restart"
   systemctl is-active --quiet $i || systemctl start $i
done
```

## Some components do not like to keep running... It seems Docker related components die?

- Notes for checking status of all components here. For example:

```bash
# oh no!  Apparenty cri-docker is sad
systemctl status cri-docker.socket

A watch for watching status, perhaps?

```bash
# verbose, but loses color green/red on active/failed
watch "echo 'DOCKER' && systemctl status docker && echo 'CRI-DOCKER' && systemctl status cri-docker.socket && echo 'CONTAINERD' && systemctl status containerd"
# straight to thepoint
watch "echo 'DOCKER' && systemctl status docker | grep 'Active' && echo 'CRI-DOCKER' && systemctl status cri-docker.socket | grep 'Active' && echo 'CONTAINERD' && systemctl status containerd | grep 'Active'"
# DOCKER

## How About Swapping Docker with CRI-O?

[CRI-O](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o) is an OCI-based implementation of
Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface.

Seems pretty good alternative.  In fact, even the exact same version support
policy of 3 minor versions is enforced, so `n-2` and then CRI-O version is
considered unsupported, as the version of Kuberentes that matches.

[CRI-O Installation](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/main/install.md)

Requirements:

```bash
# do we have?
which runc
which iproute # missing...
which iptables

sudo apt install iproute # fails, apparently obsolete
sudo apt install iproute2 # hopefully replaces
```

And apparently `clear-containers`, so
