# Vagrant Ubuntu VM

Note that I also have a github repo of past vagrant boxes:

## Vagrant on MacOS

For this to work, I use:

- Macbook Pro M3 Pro
    - Apple silicon throws a snag since it is arm64 not x86
- Vagrant
- qemu

There were several reference posts from those who came before me
that helped get this working.

## Vagrant User

- https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/boxes/base
Reminder that a user/pass is required for use of Vagrant.
- `vagrant` as SSH user to machine
- `vagrant` as group the user belongs to
- `vagrant` is also the password to the vagrant user

This is not complicated. ðŸ˜€

## Vagrant SSH

Use the default user for SSH.
Or, configure SSH via

- `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for the `vagrant` user.
- File permissions should be `0700` for `~/.ssh` and `0600` for the file.


# Vagrant on Apple Silicon with QEMU Provider

Note that I also have a github repo of past vagrant boxes:
- https://github.com/benjaminapetersen/vagrant-box-hackeries

## Vagrant With QEMU Provider

- `qemu` is the provider that I have found works with Apple Silicon,
such as my Macbook Pro M3 Pro.

## Vagrant plugins, but not all needed

I originally tried `vagrant-vmware-desktop` but that does not seem to work with MacOS Silicon.

Currently, this is what my environment looks like:

```bash
# needed for vagrant plugin
# brew unlink libvirt && brew link libvirt
brew install libvirt

# need to start libvirt if want it
brew services start libvirt

# i had previously installed these
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvert
vagrant plugin install vagrant-share
vagrant plugin install vagrant-qemu 
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-desktop

vagrant plugin list    
# vagrant-qemu (0.3.6, global)
# vagrant-vmware-desktop (3.0.3, global)

vagrant box list                
# perk/ubuntu-2204-arm64 (libvirt, 20230712, (arm64))

# don't forget this one for checking on your running VMs
vagrant global-status
```
I do have `VMware Fusion` installed in my `/Applications`, via `brew install`.  
I also ran:

```bash
# again, not using VMware here, however.
# we are using qemu
brew install vagrant virtualbox
brew install --cask vmware-fusion
brew install vagrant-vmware-desktop
brew install --cask vagrant-vmware-utility
# utm is a GUI, it works, I have an Ubuntu and a Windows box 
# but we want the vagrant experience without a GUI.
brew install utm --cask && brew link utm --cask
```

## Vagrant File

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.hostname = "ubuntu-via-qemu"
  config.vm.box = "perk/ubuntu-2204-arm64"
  # this is important for defining qemu
  config.vm.provider "qemu" do |qe|
    qe.ssh_port = "50022" # change ssh port as needed
  end
  # this seems to work for shared folders
  # SMB is the mechanism for file sharing.
  # SMB: Server Message Block, is a fundamental 
  # network file-sharing protocol
  config.vm.synced_folder "/Users/benjaminpetersen/Vagrant/qemu-ubuntu/shared_dir", "/home/shared_dir", type: "smb", smb_host: "10.0.2.2"
end
```

Then invoke with the flag:

```bash
# --provider must be provided or vagrant up will not work
vagrant up --provider=qemu
```
Or optionally set the default provider env var:

```bash
# or set in ~/. zshenv
# (not in ~/.zshrc or ~/.zshprofile) 
export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=qemu # kvm, etc
```

## File Sharing: SMB settings for MacOS

Originally via this gist:
- https://github.com/ppggff/vagrant-qemu

On the Macbook:
- System Settings
    - Sharing
        - File Sharing "on"
            - Shared folders
                - <Your Username> shared folder
                - <Your Username> Read & Write 
        - Click "File Sharing â“˜" icon to open a menu.
            - Do not allow full access for all users. Don't be crazy.
            - Click "Options" in bottom of dialog
                - Click/Toggle "Shar files and folders using SMB"
                - Click/Toggle check for <Your Username>
                - Done

To finish, once you run `vagrant up` you will have to enter 
- <Your Username> from host machine
- <Your Password> from host machine
To enable the file sharing to finish setup.
